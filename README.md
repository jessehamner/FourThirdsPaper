# FourThirdsPaper
Four-thirds radio propagation graph paper, made using GNUplot

If you don't know what this even means, read this first:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-line-of-sight_propagation

You might also want to read NAVELEX 0101,112, from May 1972
as a useful extra study, found on http://www.navy-radio.com 
and doubtlessly elsewhere.

I found that I needed this paper and couldn't find any online
(EDIT: added links below).

I have an example in the International Microwave Handbook,
second edition (Andy Barter, ed.), and found a copy of a 
sheet of this kind of paper. I re-did the math myself 
(caveat emptor) and confirmed that the tangents matched up 
pretty well. 

I did find two downloadable sheets at 
http://www.eeweb.com/electronics-forum/43-earth-radius-graphs-used-for-rf-link-design --

and

So interested users might like those as well.
