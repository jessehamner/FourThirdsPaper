# FourThirdsPaper
Four-thirds radio propagation graph paper, made using [GNUplot]
(http://www.gnuplot.info/)

If you don't know what this even means, [read this Wikipedia Article first.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-line-of-sight_propagation)

You might also want to read NAVELEX 0101,112, from May 1972
as a useful extra study, found at [navy-radio.com](http://www.navy-radio.com),
[virhistory.com](http://www.virhistory.com/navy/manuals/shore-commsta.htm), and doubtlessly elsewhere.

I found that I needed this paper and couldn't find any online
(EDIT: added links below).

I have an example in the *International Microwave Handbook*,
second edition (Andy Barter, ed.), and found a copy of a 
sheet of this kind of paper. I re-did the math myself 
(caveat emptor) and confirmed that the tangents matched up 
pretty well. 

I did find two downloadable sheets at 
[eeweb.com](http://www.eeweb.com/electronics-forum/43-earth-radius-graphs-used-for-rf-link-design) --
[this one](http://s.eeweb.com/members/cody_miller/answers/1308244362-4-3-earth.pdf)
and
[this one](http://s.eeweb.com/members/cody_miller/answers/1308342903-4-3EarthRadius2.pdf)

So interested users might like those as well.
